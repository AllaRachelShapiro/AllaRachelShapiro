					<h4>About</h4>
          
					<p>I am a licensed psychotherapist in New York and New Jersey who is passionate about helping children and adolescents, couples and parents navigate relationship issues that directly impact your quality of life. I work to improve communication skills with whoever is in the room with me so that you can gain relationship satisfaction, and establish an environment that promotes emotional and relational intelligence. I have extensive experience with young children and adolescents and their families, and Iâ€™ve helped individuals dealing with depression, anxiety, and trauma. I additionally offer supervision to limited permits.
</p>
					<p>From an early age I realized that I would work in psychology. I was always fascinated by the impact that our emotions have on our lives and how that shapes the stories we tell ourselves about the world around us and what the story we share about ourselves for the world to see. Many people beieve emotions are a nuisaance, a sign of weakness and I have always advocated for that being a huge misconception. Emotions are good information and we need to embrace all the feels, not run from them or they will chase us and we will be ruled by them regardless. Moreover, I was always interested in how relationships with our caregivers can shape our foundation for what kind of relationships we have in the future. 
					
					<p>In my undergrad, I studied psychology and children's studies as I have always felt a deep protectiveness and responsibility to advocate for our next generation and I knew it would be in a clinical setting doing hands on work where I can really make an impact. I went on to graduate and did alot of research and published in scientific journals about trauma, depression, and cognitive processing which solidified my decision of pursuing a master's in Mental Health Counseling. My post-graduate training was completed in an outpatient medical setting, with extensive experience with both adults and children. I was trained in a variety of modalities including CBT, IPT, DBT, ACT, PMT, CCPT-I, and Gottman Level 1 and 2. In my experience, I believe that pulling from these orientations are effective and still the most important component in therapy is the therapeutic alliance.
</p>

					<p>I truly find it a privilege to have you share your life experiences with me and be along side you on your journey to optimal mental health. Currently I am accepting new clients, and I eagerly welcome you to call or e-mail me for a free phone consultation.</p>
