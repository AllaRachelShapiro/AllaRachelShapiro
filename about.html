					<h4>About</h4>
          
					<p>I am passionate in helping couples navigate their roles in relationships as well as their potential roles as parents. My goal is to guide you through the challenges you’ll face as parents gain relationship satisfaction, and establish an environment that promotes emotional and relational intelligence and supports your children's brain development. I have extensive experience with young children and adolescents and their families, and I’ve helped individuals dealing with depression, anxiety, and trauma. I additionally offer supervision to limited permits.
</p>
					<p>I aim to help you bridge what happens in our sessions into your lives and into your relationships. I pull from a variety of interventions including the Gottman method, and other multidisciplinary approaches to help you strengthen your connection with yourself, your significant other, and your family as a whole.
</p>
					<p>I truly find it a privilege to have you share your life experiences with me and be along side you on your journey to optimal mental health. Currently I am accepting new clients, and I eagerly welcome you to call or e-mail me for a free phone consultation.</p>
