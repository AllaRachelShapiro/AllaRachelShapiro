					<h4>About</h4>
          
					<p>I am a licensed psychotherapist in New York and New Jersey who is passionate about helping children and adolescents, couples and parents navigate relationship issues that directly impact your quality of life. I work to improve communication skills with whoever is in the room with me so that you can gain relationship satisfaction, and establish an environment that promotes emotional and relational intelligence. I have extensive experience with young children and adolescents and their families, and Iâ€™ve helped individuals dealing with depression, anxiety, and trauma. I additionally offer supervision to limited permits.
</p>
					<p>I aim to help you bridge what happens in our sessions into your lives and into your relationships. I pull from a variety of interventions including the Gottman method, and other multidisciplinary approaches to help you strengthen your connection with yourself, your significant other, and your family as a whole.
</p>
					<p>I truly find it a privilege to have you share your life experiences with me and be along side you on your journey to optimal mental health. Currently I am accepting new clients, and I eagerly welcome you to call or e-mail me for a free phone consultation.</p>
